## 🤝 Contributing

This is a collaborative academic project developed by BSCPE 1-2 | Group 1 – Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, Department of Computer Engineering, 2025.

### 🧾 Workflow
- All contributors work directly on the `main` branch.
- Each member is responsible for committing only working code to avoid breaking features.
- Always pull the latest changes (`git pull`) before starting work to avoid conflicts.
- Manual testing is expected before each commit.

### 🔧 Code Practices
- Follow Python and Django best practices (PEP 8 for Python).
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Avoid unused imports, redundant code, or large functions — break down logic where possible.
- Frontend: Maintain clean, consistent HTML/CSS/JS structure. Keep HTML and CSS separate.
  - Use external `.css` files for styling, not inline styles or `<style>` tags.
  - Organize CSS by sections (e.g., layout, typography, components).
- Backend: Keep views, models, and serializers modular.

### ✅ Commits
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.
  - ✅ Good: `Fix login redirect on successful auth`
  - ❌ Bad: `Update`
- Use English for all commit messages and code comments.

### 🗂️ File Management
- Do not upload large files, `.env`, or personal configs.
- Add new dependencies responsibly and update `requirements.txt` using:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
